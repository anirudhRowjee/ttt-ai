## Aim
To implement a two-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe that's playable by both one and two players at once.

    * Start the Game
    * Decide whose turn it is
    * Ask the Player for input (position)
    * Validate the position
    * Make the move
    * Check for win/tie
    * Report outcome if any
    * Repeat

2. **Mode 2**: The Players will be able to play against the computer
    * Start the Game
    * Ask the User to Input their choice, or make the first move
    * Evaluate Game Tree from current state
    * apply _minimax_ and _alpha-beta pruning_ to decide optimal move
    * play the optimal move
    * Repeat until game is over
